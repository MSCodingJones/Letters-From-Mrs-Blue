                        <p class="bio">Bridgette Donald-Blue is a teacher through and through! She is a native of Miami, Florida who was raised in Ocala, Florida by her great grandmother and her aunt who were intensely encouraging about education.  Bridgette left Florida to attend Howard University where she majored in Psychology and English. Her original plan was to become a lawyer, but a chance encounter with the Teach for America organization during her senior year set her on a new path. Investing well beyond the two-year commitment required for Teach for America, today, Bridgette has over 30 years of teaching experience. She holds a Master’s degree in Educational Administration from Cal State University Dominguez Hills (CSUDH) and has been a National Board Certified Teacher since 2004. She served as an adjunct professor at UCLA in the Center X National Board for Certification and CSUDH in the teacher credentialing program. When she’s not teaching, Bridgette is also an avid supporter and volunteer for The Girls Scouts of America. <br>
                        Criss crossing the US seeking opportunities to teach in underserved communities, Bridgette currently teaches K-5 mathematics at Coliseum Street Elementary School in the heart of Los Angeles. Her husband Nate, and two daughters, Katherine and Victoria are at the core of her support system of love and family. None of them were surprised when in 2022, Bridgette became Los Angeles County Teacher of the Year and LAUSD Teacher of the Year. From 66 counties throughout the state of California, Bridgette became the 2023 California Teacher of the Year.

                        <p class="bio">Everyone, including Bridgette, however, were really surprised by the call she received in July 2023 from Sony Studios asking her to come audition to fill in for the incomparable Vanna White for a week on The Wheel of Fortune. At the time, Vanna White was recovering from COVID-19. Worried if her sneakers could ever fill the high heels of Vanna White for even a second, Bridgette and her “Letters from Mrs. Blue” week with the puzzle board that aired October 2-6, 2023 caught national attention from Today with Hoda & Jenna, Michael Stahand, and ABC World News. <br> 
                        Bridgette’s experience with The Wheel of Fortune, support of her family, and holding strong to knowing that education is something that no one can take away from you, has inspired her to take things to the next level. She’s adding on to her titles of being a mother, wife, and teacher, to become a speaker and author by expanding her “Letters from Mrs. Blue” brand to educate teachers, parents, administrators and all who care about education. <br>
                        She plans to use this platform to increase parent involvement, audit curriculums across the US and encourage everyday people to volunteer, mentor, fundraise, monitor, and share expertise in our public schools.
