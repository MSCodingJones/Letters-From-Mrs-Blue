                            It is a rainy February morning in Los Angeles and I am thinking of you. I don't know if I ever expressed to you how much I love you.  I never need to think too hard to see your beautiful smile or hear your soothing melodic voice.

                            Thank you. Thank you for introducing me to books and the love of reading. Growing up in rural Florida on a little dirt road, being  able to read was a gift. I could travel to far away places and be many characters through the books I got from the public library.   You gave me this gift. For the life of me, I can not remember any of the stories you read to me, but I certainly remember the way I   felt. 
                            <br>
                            You made me feel so special. You took time to see me. You took time to listen to me. I just remember feeling cherished. You read    stories that made me laugh and wonder. You didn't just read to me at bedtime. I remember reading outside in the grass inthe warm sun  with the dogs running around the yard. I remember reading in the living room on the couch after Sunday service, while waiting for the pound cake in the oven that perfumed the air. I remember reading in the morning in bed smelling bacon cooking in the kitchen.

                            I always looked forward to your visits to Grandmother's house. Although I never knew when you would come, your visits were a   treasured blessing. One visit in particular was during the winter. It was storming that winter when you came to Grandmother's house   late at night. I didn't know it was you. I only heard the muffled sounds from the back door late at night during a heavy rain storm. I was so excited to see you at the breakfast table on Sunday morning. I couldn't wait to get home from church to spend time with you. That year you stayed with us for a few weeks.  I remember we watched Roots on tv and you held my handand let me bury my face in your chest when scary things happened. You rubbed my cheek and told me when it was safe to look.

                            I am a reader because of you. I am a lifelong learner because of the passion you imprinted on my heart and mind about reading and   books. Because of you, I read to my daughters every night. I even read to them the first night home from the hospital. I read each of them Flossie and the Fox by Patricia McKissak. I even did the voices just like you used to do. While I did not have you to read to me every night, the time was so special I knew I wanted to give it to my daughters.

                            Uncle Ronald, I want you to know that while your physical time on this Earth was not long, your passion for reading lit a spark that  shines so brightly today. I am sad that you didn't get to see the fruits of your efforts, but let me assure you that you have left an indelible mark on the world. I am a teacher and I read to my students all the time. I am a mom that has a home filled with books. Not just books, but books sing to the soul of my children. Because of your influence, they have books with characters that look like   them. They have books about subjects they are passionate about. I give gifts of books to children for special occasions, because I   want everyone to know the love that you bestowed on me.

                            Right now, I am remembering your smile. It warms me and gives me peace. Thank you for spending a little time with the niece that was  born a day early and kept you from going to the county fair. Thank you for the light that you shine on me today. Thank you.
                            <br>
